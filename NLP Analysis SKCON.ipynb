After going though this, few small temples came on the way and after offering our prayers, we made way to the main temple. At the foot of the main temple, you get two ways. Either you can take the normal and directly make your way to the temple or you can take the other way which has a lot of step like structures in a round-robin manner. You are supposed to take one step at a time and chant \"Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare, Hare Ram Hare Ram Ram Ram Hare Hare\". I suggest you go through this charade. You feel great by the time you enter the temple. The temple hall is just beautiful. The wonderful carvings, the peaceful aura and the mesmerizing idols, simply artistic. We waited for the aarti which was divine indeed. Once you exit the hall, you exit through a lane where a lot of stalls have been put up. Its like a mini shopping complex out there. I was shocked at the commercialization of the temple but it's acceptable when you think of all those coming here. In fact, even we ended up buying an idol.

Quite expensive entrance for a temple. I accept the religious dress code so i was not alowed to enter in shorts. I had to rent an Indian lunghi, male long dress. The guards was not polite, almost unfriendly. One lady guard was about to destroy my expensive camera wich i had to leave outside. Inside the temple it was to follow the marked way. Somwhere you was blessed by some holy man. But everywhere there was stands with different things for sale. Worst was the way out with an enormous market with holy souvenirs of different quality, most kitscy plastic things\" made in China\". The holy experience i had looked forward to have dissapeared in a commercial thing. All they wanted was my money.   \n",

Wide in unexpectedly, it is the most deep atmosphere in the way of local. Worship barefoot. People of shorts will visit dressed in cloth (rental).

When you reach that destination from outside it feels like huge temple but after roaming from inside it feels like we have visited some kind of mall bacause, the temple is nice no doubt about that but there are many things from clothes, eatable stuffs are there for sell which we can experience. I said its one time visit place but must !   \n",

In the temple the painting on the ceiling is eye capturing. And when you look at the sculpture of lord Krishna and Radha it is also very beautiful.

Hare Krishna !! Krishna Krishna Hare Hare !! .. The bhajans are so devotional , poojas/aarathis are great. You get positive vibes while chanting in the main hall. A must visit place in Bangalore.

       "43  It was a spur of the moment decision to visit ISKCON temple but how glad I am that I made that decision. We reached the temple by 6 pm and so we had an hour to roam around before attending the aarti at 7. We went through the whole charade of security check in and shoes and luggage check in. After going though this, few small temples came on the way and after offering our prayers, we made way to the main temple. At the foot of the main temple, you get two ways. Either you can take the normal and directly make your way to the temple or you can take the other way which has a lot of step like structures in a round-robin manner. You are supposed to take one step at a time and chant \"Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare, Hare Ram Hare Ram Ram Ram Hare Hare\". I suggest you go through this charade. You feel great by the time you enter the temple. The temple hall is just beautiful. The wonderful carvings, the peaceful aura and the mesmerizing idols, simply artistic. We waited for the aarti which was divine indeed. Once you exit the hall, you exit through a lane where a lot of stalls have been put up. Its like a mini shopping complex out there. I was shocked at the commercialization of the temple but it's acceptable when you think of all those coming here. In fact, even we ended up buying an idol. All in all, a must visit place, probably in the morning, though the evenings are not bad either.   \n",

Quite expensive entrance for a temple. I accept the religious dress code so i was not alowed to enter in shorts. I had to rent an Indian lunghi, male long dress. The guards was not polite, almost unfriendly. One lady guard was about to destroy my expensive camera wich i had to leave outside. Inside the temple it was to follow the marked way. Somwhere you was blessed by some holy man. But everywhere there was stands with different things for sale. Worst was the way out with an enormous market with holy souvenirs of different quality, most kitscy plastic things\" made in China\". The holy experience i had looked forward to have dissapeared in a commercial thing. All they wanted was my money.\n",

Wide in unexpectedly, it is the most deep atmosphere in the way of local. Worship barefoot. People of shorts will visit dressed in cloth (rental). Yes Snack Corner, ants and souvenirs, is there a buffet restaurant, it has to some extent touristy, is only less expensive that the local-friendly, is heterogeneous. Worship time will take quite.

In the temple the painting on the ceiling is eye capturing. And when you look at the sculpture of lord Krishna and Radha it is also very beautiful. The slowing moving to exit just before it is an canteen where many varieties of food is available at reasonable rate. Had a nice time by listening to mantras at the temple and sitting peacefully.\n",

       "43                               It was a spur of the moment decision to visit ISKCON temple but how glad I am that I made that decision. We reached the temple by 6 pm and so we had an hour to roam around before attending the aarti at 7. We went through the whole charade of security check in and shoes and luggage check in. After going though this, few small temples came on the way and after offering our prayers, we made way to the main temple. At the foot of the main temple, you get two ways. Either you can take the normal and directly make your way to the temple or you can take the other way which has a lot of step like structures in a round-robin manner. You are supposed to take one step at a time and chant \"Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare, Hare Ram Hare Ram Ram Ram Hare Hare\". I suggest you go through this charade. You feel great by the time you enter the temple. The temple hall is just beautiful. The wonderful carvings, the peaceful aura and the mesmerizing idols, simply artistic. We waited for the aarti which was divine indeed. Once you exit the hall, you exit through a lane where a lot of stalls have been put up. Its like a mini shopping complex out there. I was shocked at the commercialization of the temple but it's acceptable when you think of all those coming here. In fact, even we ended up buying an idol. All in all, a must visit place, probably in the morning, though the evenings are not bad either.\n",

Paying 2 rupees at the entrance deposit the shoes, it goes into barefoot. In the middle of the course and the main hall go up the stairs to the main hall, people of devout Hindus have a prayer, myself you are coming by tourism was quite out of place feeling. Inside the main hall, but is worth of decorations and ceiling paintings are very beautiful at first glance ..., I guess that's it. Excessive expectations is taboo. Not a tourist spot view there until over time. Let's taste the atmosphere of the local Krishna temple. By the way, (it is a little exaggerated and say) dress code there is. I have the will become likely caught, that do not show the shin of the leg regardless of gender. I was wearing a short pants length, but it was me through the last minute. And also to say, in the case of NG if lost to the waist passed the cloth bath towel size, put Could you in. Shoulder can be seen (sleeveless) also, such as it was NG ···\n",

At the entrance of the Indians quietly passed, and foreign tourists stopped and asked to make a donation of 300 rupees, but you can ignore it. Just at the entrance it is necessary to leave the shoes, if you have large bags or backpacks and cameras (phones can carry). So all the best to leave valuables at home.\n",

What makes it different is their system to enter the main temple is designed such a way that no stampeding can happen. They make you chant \"Hare Krishna\" for every step you take and this way the entire queue is well managed.Though the place is getting commercialized but I feel its fine as they have to maintain huge campus and free food facility for the needy. There are books and other items which one can buy as souvenirs to this place. Over all, will recommend this place to all people with religious belief. Visited September 2012\n",

The Prasad served is very tasty and wholesome. The only thing that I felt amiss is that the temple is too high and one has to walk a lot and climb many steps which is slightly distressful for aged people.\n",

One can sit and keep adoring the beauty all day. Te inside of the main temple is breath-taking and stunning. There is however something that I don't like about it is the way it is deliberately given an angle of a shopping center with limitless merchandises that one can buy. It is really commercialized, if you will! Other than which, there is really no ticket to visit the temple. It is located right by the Orion mall so while you are there, it is certainly worth your time unless you are an atheist. There is also a nice restaurant right behind the temple - Higher Taste - that one must try out for a finger licking dining experience!\n",

The Temple is well maintained and location is also good. You can walk in at ease and offer your prayers, sit down and relax for a while listening to the chantings or observe Aarti. They server really nice food. And because of the nice location you also get to see nice Sunset from here. The place gets crowded on weekends specially during evenings so plan accordingly.\n",

       "89    Well the title says it all. This place is well barricaded, well maintained by the sevaks/security personnel who in turn guide the devotees to the main temple. Though it feels a little frustrating as you have to walk a long way up to the main temple but as you reach the main temple mere darshan of holy god takes away all your tiredness. I did not liked the way ISKCON is marketing Krishna but it's my personal view. This place is good for people who are able to walk properly and balance themselves as there's a lot of push and pull due to huge crowd gatherings. The free prasadam counter is at a very narrow corner. The temple trustee may rethink of moving it. I have visited the temple more than couple of times but will advise people/bhakts to avoid Sunday's or any special holy day since its overcrowded and it leads to fracas between the temple securities/sevaks who maintain the huge queues and even at the pvt. car entrance. For aged people although they have offered wheel chair service but it will be good if they provide sevaks to push the wheel chairs as well. Overall the experience of visiting this place is heavenly as you enter the garbha gruha or main temple you forget all your complaints,that's the beauty of god. So just a word of advice try avoid this place on overcrowded days and don't take aged people along with you who can't walk properly. The views are entirely personal not meant to be hurt anyone.

The bhajans are so devotional , poojas/aarathis are great. You get positive vibes while chanting in the main hall. A must visit place in Bangalore. At the time of krishnastami the place is really good and packed with devotees with lots of chanting s. Its clean and well maintained/organized. Do visit.\n",

      " It was a spur of the moment decision to visit ISKCON temple but how glad I am that I made that decision. We reached the temple by 6 pm and so we had an hour to roam around before attending the aarti at 7. We went through the whole charade of security check in and shoes and luggage check in. After going though this, few small temples came on the way and after offering our prayers, we made way to the main temple. At the foot of the main temple, you get two ways. Either you can take the normal and directly make your way to the temple or you can take the other way which has a lot of step like structures in a round-robin manner. You are supposed to take one step at a time and chant \"Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare, Hare Ram Hare Ram Ram Ram Hare Hare\". I suggest you go through this charade. You feel great by the time you enter the temple. The temple hall is just beautiful. The wonderful carvings, the peaceful aura and the mesmerizing idols, simply artistic. We waited for the aarti which was divine indeed. Once you exit the hall, you exit through a lane where a lot of stalls have been put up. Its like a mini shopping complex out there. I was shocked at the commercialization of the temple but it's acceptable when you think of all those coming here. In fact, even we ended up buying an idol. All in all, a must visit place, probably in the morning, though the evenings are not bad either.\n",

      " Was carried out on a Saturday morning around 10 o'clock, we were able to enter to immediately free. Paying 2 rupees at the entrance deposit the shoes, it goes into barefoot. In the middle of the course and the main hall go up the stairs to the main hall, people of devout Hindus have a prayer, myself you are coming by tourism was quite out of place feeling. Inside the main hall, but is worth of decorations and ceiling paintings are very beautiful at first glance ..., I guess that's it. Excessive expectations is taboo. Not a tourist spot view there until over time. Let's taste the atmosphere of the local Krishna temple. By the way, (it is a little exaggerated and say) dress code there is. I have the will become likely caught, that do not show the shin of the leg regardless of gender. I was wearing a short pants length, but it was me through the last minute. And also to say, in the case of NG if lost to the waist passed the cloth bath towel size, put Could you in. Shoulder can be seen (sleeveless) also, such as it was NG ···\n",

      " Temple rather unusual both outside and inside, but we were not particularly impressed by it. At the entrance of the Indians quietly passed, and foreign tourists stopped and asked to make a donation of 300 rupees, but you can ignore it. Just at the entrance it is necessary to leave the shoes, if you have large bags or backpacks and cameras (phones can carry). So all the best to leave valuables at home.\n",

      " I have been to many temples in North India but this one in south I personally like. What makes it different is their system to enter the main temple is designed such a way that no stampeding can happen. They make you chant \"Hare Krishna\" for every step you take and this way the entire queue is well managed.Though the place is getting commercialized but I feel its fine as they have to maintain huge campus and free food facility for the needy. There are books and other items which one can buy as souvenirs to this place. Over all, will recommend this place to all people with religious belief. Visited September 2012\n",

      " This place is within the city limits.. hence choosing the time of day is important... we prefer to visit the place on normal days by 11 AM to get an sober darshan.. prasad.. relax time inside the temple.. and then the food in the restaurant (which is free till 1 PM) on regular day. Good for some memorabilia from the shops within the premises... Parking is not a problem.\n",
      "Review 43:\n",
      " Much like most other ISCKON temples, the grandeur of the temple is nothing short of mesmerizing. One can sit and keep adoring the beauty all day. Te inside of the main temple is breath-taking and stunning. There is however something that I don't like about it is the way it is deliberately given an angle of a shopping center with limitless merchandises that one can buy. It is really commercialized, if you will! Other than which, there is really no ticket to visit the temple. It is located right by the Orion mall so while you are there, it is certainly worth your time unless you are an atheist. There is also a nice restaurant right behind the temple - Higher Taste - that one must try out for a finger licking dining experience!\n",

      " I have visited several Isckon Temples in and outside India. The Temple is well maintained and location is also good. You can walk in at ease and offer your prayers, sit down and relax for a while listening to the chantings or observe Aarti. They server really nice food. And because of the nice location you also get to see nice Sunset from here. The place gets crowded on weekends specially during evenings so plan accordingly.\n"

       "      <td>It was a spur of the moment decision to visit ISKCON temple but how glad I am that I made that decision. We reached the temple by 6 pm and so we had an hour to roam around before attending the aarti at 7. We went through the whole charade of security check in and shoes and luggage check in. After going though this, few small temples came on the way and after offering our prayers, we made way to the main temple. At the foot of the main temple, you get two ways. Either you can take the normal and directly make your way to the temple or you can take the other way which has a lot of step like structures in a round-robin manner. You are supposed to take one step at a time and chant \"Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare, Hare Ram Hare Ram Ram Ram Hare Hare\". I suggest you go through this charade. You feel great by the time you enter the temple. The temple hall is just beautiful. The wonderful carvings, the peaceful aura and the mesmerizing idols, simply artistic. We waited for the aarti which was divine indeed. Once you exit the hall, you exit through a lane where a lot of stalls have been put up. Its like a mini shopping complex out there. I was shocked at the commercialization of the temple but it's acceptable when you think of all those coming here. In fact, even we ended up buying an idol. All in all, a must visit place, probably in the morning, though the evenings are not bad either.</td>\n",

Quite expensive entrance for a temple. I accept the religious dress code so i was not alowed to enter in shorts. I had to rent an Indian lunghi, male long dress. The guards was not polite, almost unfriendly. One lady guard was about to destroy my expensive camera wich i had to leave outside. Inside the temple it was to follow the marked way. Somwhere you was blessed by some holy man. But everywhere there was stands with different things for sale. Worst was the way out with an enormous market with holy souvenirs of different quality, most kitscy plastic things\" made in China\". The holy experience i had looked forward to have dissapeared in a commercial thing. All they wanted was my money.   \n",

Wide in unexpectedly, it is the most deep atmosphere in the way of local. Worship barefoot. People of shorts will visit dressed in cloth (rental). Yes Snack Corner, ants and souvenirs, is there a buffet restaurant, it has to some extent touristy, is only less expensive that the local-friendly, is heterogeneous. Worship time will take quite. Severe in 1 hour.   \n",

When you reach that destination from outside it feels like huge temple but after roaming from inside it feels like we have visited some kind of mall bacause, the temple is nice no doubt about that but there are many things from clothes, eatable stuffs are there for sell which we can experience. I said its one time visit place but must !   \n",

In the temple the painting on the ceiling is eye capturing. And when you look at the sculpture of lord Krishna and Radha it is also very beautiful. The slowing moving to exit just before it is an canteen where many varieties of food is available at reasonable rate. Had a nice time by listening to mantras at the temple and sitting peacefully.   \n",

Hare Krishna !! Krishna Krishna Hare Hare !! .. The bhajans are so devotional , poojas/aarathis are great. You get positive vibes while chanting in the main hall. A must visit place in Bangalore.

       "43  It was a spur of the moment decision to visit ISKCON temple but how glad I am that I made that decision. We reached the temple by 6 pm and so we had an hour to roam around before attending the aarti at 7. We went through the whole charade of security check in and shoes and luggage check in. After going though this, few small temples came on the way and after offering our prayers, we made way to the main temple. At the foot of the main temple, you get two ways. Either you can take the normal and directly make your way to the temple or you can take the other way which has a lot of step like structures in a round-robin manner. You are supposed to take one step at a time and chant \"Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare, Hare Ram Hare Ram Ram Ram Hare Hare\". I suggest you go through this charade. You feel great by the time you enter the temple. The temple hall is just beautiful. The wonderful carvings, the peaceful aura and the mesmerizing idols, simply artistic. We waited for the aarti which was divine indeed. Once you exit the hall, you exit through a lane where a lot of stalls have been put up. Its like a mini shopping complex out there. I was shocked at the commercialization of the temple but it's acceptable when you think of all those coming here. In fact, even we ended up buying an idol. All in all, a must visit place, probably in the morning, though the evenings are not bad either.   \n",

It can be said that bigram gives a better perspective of the sentiment or improves the sentiment analysis as it provides additional or more complete context. It clearly captures relationships between words. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): It considers the frequency of each word in the given text and frequency in the entire corpus. This method helps us identify important words, those words that might be common but are rare words in the overall corpus. We found that \"temple\" has the maximum TF-IDF weight of 330.6, this means that it occurs the most frequently in the text. It is followed by the words - \"place\", \"good\", \"nice\" and \"visit\". It can be concluded that overall there seem to be a positive feedback or review from the visitors as words like good and nice appear in the Top 5 with maximum TF-IDF weight. This can be further used for sentiment analysis. \n",

    "### Answer:  Before proceeding to sampling, we did basic EDA on dataset and found that the POSITIVE review appears 4002 times, followed by MIXED and NEGATIVE with 277 and 270 frequency. NEUTRAL review appears only 92 times. Thus, there is class imbalance in the dataset and hence we used two sampling strategies as mentioned below. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Undersampling - In this, we reduce the number of instances in the majority class to balance the number of instances in the minority class. This can be done by randomly selecting a subset of instances from the majority class until the number of instances in the majority class is equal to or closer to the number of instances in the minority class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Oversampling - In this, we increase the number of instances in the minority class by randomly duplicating instances from the minority class until the number of instances in the minority class is equal to or closer to the number of instances in the majority class. Oversampling can be done using various techniques such as Random Oversampling, Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), Adaptive Synthetic Sampling (ADASYN). We see above, that after oversampling all the 4 sentiment reviews have equal value = 4000.\n"

       "0  This reativly new temple was a big hindu version of Disney Land.... Quite expensive entrance for a temple. I accept the religious dress code so i was not alowed to enter in shorts. I had to rent an Indian lunghi, male long dress. The guards was not polite, almost unfriendly. One lady guard was about to destroy my expensive camera wich i had to leave outside. Inside the temple it was to follow the marked way. Somwhere you was blessed by some holy man. But everywhere there was stands with different things for sale. Worst was the way out with an enormous market with holy souvenirs of different quality, most kitscy plastic things\" made in China\". The holy experience i had looked forward to have dissapeared in a commercial thing. All they wanted was my money.   \n",

    "1. AFINN Lexicon (Affective Norms for English Words): It is a simple lexicon-based approach for sentiment analysis and consists of a list of words that have been manually assigned a polarity score. This score is a numerical value indicating the sentiment or emotion associated with that word. Each word is given a score ranging from -5 (most negative) to 5 (most positive), with 0 being neutral score. In our text above, AFINN score was assigned to a total of 4641 words. Here, we see that about 4060 positive reviews and about 581 negative reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Text Blob - It is a pre-trained sentiment analysis model that can be used to classify the sentiment of text as positive, negative, or neutral. It uses a rule-based approach to assign polarity scores to individual words and then aggregates the scores to determine the overall sentiment of the text. The overall results, as shown above, of the confusion matrix and classification results are found to be better than previous ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Vader Lexicon (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) - It is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool specifically designed for social media texts. It takes into account the nuances of social media language, such as the use of slang, emojis, and capitalization, in order to provide accurate sentiment analysis. Vader assigns each word in the text a polarity score, which ranges from -1 (most negative) to 1 (most positive), and also provides a compound score, which represents the overall sentiment of the text. The compound score is a normalized, weighted composite score that ranges from -1 to 1, where values above 0.05 are generally considered positive, values below -0.05 are considered negative, and values in between are considered neutral. The specific results of Vader Lexicon are shown above.\n"

    "### Answer: The most crucial step for the deployment of this model is data collection as currently the temple is using less-than-adequate and unreliable ways of data collection. In order to encourage people to fill in more feedback during the visit to the temple, the temple can look into installing electronic kiosks which provide information about the temple as well as allow feedback and suggestions. Additionally, we should build an automated pipeline to periodically scrape all popular social media websites for any relevant reviews instead of having the IT team manually search for them.\n",
